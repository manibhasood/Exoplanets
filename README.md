# Exoplanet Habitability Analysis

This project analyzes the Exoplanets dataset to investigate potential habitability based on surface temperature, size, and atmospheric composition.

## Project Overview

We're exploring exoplanet data to:
1. Compare different exoplanets
2. Assess potential habitability
3. Analyze key factors:
   - Surface temperature
   - Planet size
   - Atmospheric gases

## Data Source

Our analysis uses the exoplanet dataset, which contains information on confirmed exoplanets discovered by various missions and observatories.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Temperature range analysis
- Size comparison with Earth-like planets
- Atmospheric composition study
- Habitability scoring system

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models (if applicable)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `Exoplanets.ipynb` to start the analysis
